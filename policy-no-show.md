# {{ page.title }}

No-show papers, posters, and demos are defined as papers submitted by authors who subsequently did not present the paper in-person (no videos, no remote cast) at the technical meeting.
Presentations by proxies are not allowed.
No-shows will not be available on ACM Digital Library or other public access ACM forums.
No refund of the paid fees can be claimed by the no-show author.

Exceptions to this policy will be made by the Technical Program Chair of the conference only if there is evidence that the no-show occurred because of unanticipated events beyond the control of the authors, and every option available to the authors to present the paper was exhausted.
