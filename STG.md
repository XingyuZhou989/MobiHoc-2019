## NSF Student Travel Grant
The ACM MobiHoc 2023 is pleased to announce the availability of the US National Science Foundation (NSF) travel grant opportunity for US-based students. To qualify, a student must be a full-time student at US institutions. MobiHoc 2023 will be able to partially support (based on need) the travel, accommodation, and registration costs of student registrants who might otherwise be unable to attend the conference.

### Eligibility Requirements
All full-time undergraduate or graduate students from US institutions may apply, regardless of their citizenship/visa status. We also encourage those who do not have a paper in the conference, but wish to attend, to submit a travel grant application. We anticipate funding, thanks to the US NSF support, for approximately 15 students at a rate of up to $1,200 per student. Priorities will be given to under-represented groups including women, minorities, persons with disabilities, or persons from other under-represented groups. Student recipients will be reimbursed (based on valid receipt) after the conference. In order to have their airfare to be reimbursed, students must book their flights from US-based carriers.

### Submission Instructions
An application for a travel grant should be sent to the student travel grants chairs Huacheng Zeng [hzeng@msu.edu](hzeng@msu.edu) and Morteza Hashemi [mhashemi@ku.edu](mhashemi@ku.edu) by email as a **single PDF file**, with the subject “Application to NSF Student Travel Grant for 2023 ACM MobiHoc.” Applications for funding should be submitted before **September 1, 2023**.

### Application Materials
An application for a student travel grant will consist of the following documents, and incomplete applications will not be considered.
1. A request letter from the student (see below).
2. The student's Curriculum Vitae.
3. A recommendation letter from the student's graduate advisor.
4. An estimate of the following costs of attending MobiHoc: airfare, hotel, and registration. It is anticipated that travel grants will partially cover these overall costs.

#### Letter from the student
A letter from the student should include the following information.
(1) A brief summary of research interests and accomplishments to date; students should demonstrate a serious interest in networking, through their course work and projects.
(2) A description of areas reflected in the MobiHoc 2023 program that would impact the student’s research.
(3) A statement about why the conference attendance is important to the student. The paper title should be included in the letter if the student is the presenting author of a paper that has been accepted by MobiHoc 2023. Student authors from accepted posters, demos, and workshop papers are also encouraged to apply.

#### Letter from the student’s advisor
A recommendation letter from the student’s advisor includes the following information.
(1) The suitability of the MobiHoc 2023 program material to the student’s research area.
(2) Ways this particular person would benefit from attendance at the conference.
(3) The strengths and potential contributions of the applicant.
(4) Committing to covering the cost of travel in excess of the travel grant.

**NOTE**: Incomplete applications will not be considered. The supported students have to submit their travel receipts after the MobiHoc symposium, including airfare receipt (with a copy of boarding pass) and hotel receipt.
