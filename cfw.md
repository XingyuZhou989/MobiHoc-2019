ACM MobiHoc 2023 will be held in Washington DC, USA, between October 23-26, 2023. In addition to the main program, the conference will feature a set of workshops.

The goal of the workshops is to gather recent research on focused topics of interest, and to provide a forum for authors to present early results on these topics. We seek workshops capable of putting together a high-quality program from contributed and/or invited papers presenting novel ideas in the less formal settings that are typical of workshop meetings.

We invite proposals from both individuals and teams interested in organizing strong workshops on any topic related to the main MobiHoc conference. Preference will be given to emerging topics in networking and mobile computing.

Workshop proposals should provide the following information:

- Title, scope, and topics of the workshop.

- Name, affiliation, and short bio of workshop organizers.

- Tentative committee lists (organizers, steering committee if any, etc.).

- Workshop planned format (papers, demos, panels, etc.). Please indicate if you would prefer the workshop to be a full-day or half-day workshop. If accepted, the workshop length may be changed later depending on the number of paper submissions received.

- Past history of the workshop (if and where held, number of papers submitted and accepted, number of participants).

- Rationale: Why is the topic current and important? Is it an emerging topic? Why would the workshop attract a significant number of submissions of good quality and a large number of attendees?

- A comparison to recent (within the past 2 years) workshops on related topics at previous editions of MobiHoc or other conferences such as INFOCOM, ICNP, MOBICOM, SIGMETRICS, etc. Please indicate how you plan to differentiate this workshop from those held at these other venues.

- A draft call for papers with tentative dates, if available. Please note that the dates for paper submission, notification, and camera-ready version may need to be changed to fit the conference publication schedule.

- Brief description of the dissemination plan (publicity, online presence, etc.). At least one organizer of each accepted workshop must be physically present during the event.

Please submit workshop proposals in PDF format to the co-chairs by email (mobihoc23.workshops@gmail.com), with subject line [MobiHoc’23 Workshop Proposal Submission: “workshop name”]. Submissions must be received by the deadline below.

6. Rationale: Why is the topic current and important? Why would the workshop attract a significant number of submissions of good quality and a large number of
attendees? Please include a draft call for papers, if available. The dates for paper submission, notification, and camera-ready version would preferably be coordinated across the selected workshops.
