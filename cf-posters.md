# {{ page.title }}

MobiHoc 2023 solicits submissions for a poster session dedicated to sharing late-breaking results or work-in-progress on any topic related to dynamic networked systems. Posters provide a chance for in-depth research discussions with other conference attendees and are therefore especially well suited for obtaining feedback on ongoing research or controversial ideas. Submissions on any topics within the scope of the Call for Papers are encouraged and welcomed.

We also seek proposals for live demonstrations of mobile computing or network technologies. Particularly encouraged are the demonstrations that include participation by conference attendees. Research prototypes, as well as commercial products, are welcome. However, MobiHoc is not an appropriate forum for marketing or sales presentations. The presenter is expected to understand the system being demonstrated and explain the technical contributions of the system to the audience. Demonstrations of previously published systems are also welcome. Demonstrations will be selected based on the expected interest from the MobiHoc audience.


## Best Poster and Demo Awards

The MobiHoc 2023 Demo and Poster committees will review all submissions to select the accepted demos and posters. All accepted submissions will be considered for Best Demo and Best Poster Awards. A committee will decide the winner(s) after evaluating all presentations at the conference.


## Poster Submissions and Selection

Prospective poster presenters should submit a poster abstract with a maximum length of 2 pages, including all figures and references. Poster abstracts must be formatted with the [ACM style sheet](http://www.acm.org/publications/article-templates/proceedings-template.html). The abstract title should begin with `"Poster: "`.  If you are using LaTeX, you can make use of [a simplified ACM conference template](https://github.com/conference-websites/acmart-sigproc-template).  The review is single-blind, that is, the author names should be listed on the submission.  Submissions will be reviewed by a poster selection committee.

Poster abstract should be submitted through [HotCRP](https://mobihoc23posterdemo.hotcrp.com/). Accepted poster abstracts will be included in the conference proceedings and listed on the conference website. Each accepted poster must be presented in person at the conference. Easels will be provided at the conference.


## Demo Submissions and Selection

A demo submission requires an extended abstract with a maximum length of 2 pages, including all figures and references, describing the demonstration as well as any special requirements (other than a demo booth/table). The extended abstract should be formatted with the [ACM style sheet](http://www.acm.org/publications/article-templates/proceedings-template.html). If you are using LaTeX, you can make use of [a simplified ACM conference template](https://github.com/conference-websites/acmart-sigproc-template).  The demo title should begin with `"Demo: "`.

The review is single-blind, and the submission should include

- the names, affiliations, and email addresses of the authors,
- equipment to be used for the demo,
- space needed and the required setup time,
- additional facilities needed, including power and Internet/wireless access.

Demo proposals should be submitted through [HotCRP](https://mobihoc23posterdemo.hotcrp.com/). Accepted demo proposals will be included in the conference proceedings and listed on the conference website.

Authors of accepted Demo proposals are encouraged to submit a companion video clip showcasing their demo. Video clips should highlight the technical contributions of the demo and be no more than 90 seconds in length. Demo video clips will be posted on the conference website. Videos can be submitted by including a link to the video along with the extended abstract submission.
